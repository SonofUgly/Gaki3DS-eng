# Gaki no Tsukai 3DS - English
Translation of ダウンタウンのガキの使いやあらへんで！！絶対に捕まってはいけないガースー黒光りランド

Using [Yandex's OCR](https://translate.yandex.com/ocr) and [DeepL's AI translation.](https://www.deepl.com/translator)

**Note:** There's a ticker on the bottom of the top screen during gameplay that uses in-game text, this is not translated as it requires game files to be modified (ie. a ROMhack), and this is just a texture pack. All other text in the game is translated.

## Install (Citra texture pack)
Put the `000400000017D800` folder into /[user](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/User-Directory)/load/texture/

In Citra's graphic settings turn on `Use Custom Textures`
